NAME
    RT-Extension-AutomaticAssignment -

INSTALLATION
    RT-Extension-AutomaticAssignment requires version RT 4.2.0 or later.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        This step may require root permissions.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin( "RT::Extension::AutomaticAssignment" );

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
    Create scrips
        This lets you control which circumstances automatic assignment
        should take place. For example, perhaps you want an On Create,
        Automatic Assignment scrip on some of your queues. Any tickets
        explicitly created with an owner will retain that owner. You may
        also want an On Queue Change, Automatic Reassignment scrip. For
        Automatic Reassignment, the automatic assignment will happen even if
        the ticket has an owner already.
