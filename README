NAME
    RT-Extension-AutomaticAssignment - automatically assign tickets based on
    rules

INSTALLATION
    RT-Extension-AutomaticAssignment requires version RT 4.2.0 or later.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        This step may require root permissions.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin( "RT::Extension::AutomaticAssignment" );

        You may wish to also add this line if you want to use the "Work
        Schedule" filter, which exposes the RT's SLA business hours as
        custom field values:

            Set( @CustomFieldValuesSources, "RT::CustomFieldValues::ServiceBusinessHours" );

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
    Create scrips
        You may control which circumstances automatic assignment should take
        place using RT's scrips system. For example, perhaps you want an "On
        Create, Automatic Assignment" scrip on some of your queues. Any
        tickets explicitly created with an owner will retain that owner, but
        unowned tickets will use the automatic assignment system. You may
        also want an "On Queue Change, Automatic Reassignment" scrip. The
        "Automatic Reassignment" action is slightly different from
        "Automatic Assignment" action because reassignment will happen even
        if the ticket has an owner already.

        You may specify as many automatic assignment and reassignment scrips
        as you like. The automatic assignment admin UI will warn you,
        however, if it finds no scrips.

    Configure automatic assignment policies
        Visit Admin -> Queues -> Select -> (queue) -> Automatic Assignment
        to configure the automatic assignment policy for a queue.

        There are two important stages to the automatic assignment policy.
        First, you configure rules for deciding which users are eligible to
        be automatically assigned tickets (based on time of day, group
        membership, etc). Next, you configure a policy for deciding which of
        those eligible users will be made the owner of each ticket (who has
        the fewest open tickets, randomly, etc).

        Filters are policies which reduce the number of potential candidate
        owners based on the specified rule. For example, the "Member of
        Group" filter limits automatic assignment to only members of the
        selected group. The "Work Schedule" filter allows users (or,
        perhaps, only their manager) to select which business hours that
        they are available. You may specify zero, one, or more filters. Each
        user must fulfill the requirements of *all* the filters to be
        included in automatic assignment.

        Chooser is the policy that automatic assignment uses to pick a
        single owner from a list of many potential candidates. The most
        basic Chooser is "Random". A more useful Chooser is "Active
        Tickets": the user with the fewest number of active tickets in the
        queue is assigned the ticket. The "Round Robin" Chooser distributes
        tickets to each candidate owner evenly.

        Each Filter and Chooser provides its documentation and configuration
        directly on the automatic assignment interface.
